Human Magic: Thaumaturgy
------------------------
    All humans feel the fire in their hearts. It appeared at the end of an age - it appeared when the aesir died and the world burned. It comes from he same place as the Voice - most shut it out, instinctively shy away. It takes an extreme act of will to reach past that to pull out the fire, and an even stronger one to stay sane while doing so. Only the desparate and the insane use magic.


Unicorn Magic: Rune Magic
-------------------------
    Unicorn magic relies on the manipulation of starlight. Starlight falls from the sky, an invisible haze which pools in valleys, collects in pools and runs in streams and rivers. It burns away in sunlight, and remains strongest in shadowed areas. Unicorns collect starlight, like water in a bucket, using special crystals grown from plants they cultivate in groves. These crystals protect its energies from sunlight, and prevent the starlight from flowing, making it easier to work. Some creatures grow their own special crystals, as do unicorns themselves. The crystal in their horns allows them to both see and work starlight naturally.
    Starlight is colored by emotion and thought. It can be tainted by dark emotions, and suffused with positive thoughts. Likewise, the "essence" of whatever it is in contact with for a long time rubs off on it, also coloring it. Starlight resonates with all things it is colored with, and most strongly with other pools of similar resonance. This resonance is instantaneous, and appears to be unaffected by distance. Magic worked with starlight is performed by collecting a large enough pool of a certain resonance and manipulating it, which ultimately manipulates the reality it resonates with. Starlight magic is least effective at manipulating the physical world of matter, more effective at manipulating the various mercurial energies, and most effective at manipulating the etherial world of thoughts, perception and emotions.

## Runes
    While the manipulation of raw starlight is possible, greater effect can be wielded by the craft and use of runes. Runes are symbols, abstract representations of the material to be manipulated and the type of manipulation desired. Runes are difficult, variable things. The symbols which make up a rune are a combination of visual representation, symbolism in the collective consciousness, the natural paths by which starlight flows around a given object or effect, even the internal psychological representation of the caster. Runes are painstakingly developed, carefully guarded, passed along from teacher to student and modified and customized by each individual practitioner. The most powerful practitioners custom craft each rune for the particular effects of the spell being cast at the time, while common use runes may be used over and over, sometimes even etched or carved permanently into solid objects such as marble blocks or metal plates.
    By chanelling starlight into a rune, the starlight resonates much more strongly with the properties of the rune, allowing for greater effects and the use of less power. A suitably crafted rune need only starlight to power it. Among unicorns, it is common to have runes available for public use for various tasks and purposes. The unicorn need only focus its own natural energies upon the rune, and the desired effect occurs. This does take a little practice, but it's a common enough skill among unicorns. Various devices can also be devised, using a combination of runes and powering crystals. The crystal itself provides the energy, which when released into the rune generates a single effect.

## Laws of Runemagic

    ### Law of Contamination ###
        As starlight is naturally affected by its environment, the Law Of Contamination is fundamental to the art. Many practitioners are obsessed with obtaining the purest starlight, so that it won't affect the casting of their spells. Strong emotions can taint the starlight used in a spell, throwing off the casting with unwanted effects. Likewise, Contamination is often used in many spells by obtaining some piece of the spell's target, such as a hair or a suitable symbol which is bathed in the starlight to be used. By Contamination, a spell's target and effects can be changed without changing the rune itself.

        #### Tennent of Will ####
            Not a law in itself, the Tennent of Will is a natural outcome of the Law of Contamination. Will is extremely important to runemages, as the will of the caster affects the starlight he wields directly. Much can be done by will alone, along with sufficient starlight, and even static runes can have variable effects with a suitable application of Will. It should be noted that the will of the target of a spell also has effect. A strong enough will can stave off harmful magics or redirect their effects. When affecting a suitably skilled living being, it is most wise to do so subtly, lest they make the work that much more difficult.

    ### Law of Resistance ###
        Physical materials have an affect on starlight, and in particular the effects of starlight spells. Matter "slows down" starlight and depletes it. While starlight freely flows across the material world, attempting to affect the world with it suffuses the target with energy, much of which is lost in the process. Therefore, larger objects require an exponentially greater amount of starlight for the same effect. Energies, such as electricity, heat and light require significantly less starlight to manipulate, and "drag" upon it less. While affecting a great deal of energy requires a large amount of starlight, it doesn't take nearly as much as material things. Finally, aetherial materials have almost no resistance to starlight. These include thoughts and emotions, spirits and ghosts, and perceptions and senses. The materials involved greatly affect the casting of runic spells. While a runemage _can_ turn himself invisible by bending light around himself, it is much more efficient to simply alter the perceptions of those around him so that they don't notice he's there.

        #### Tennent of Silk ####
            Silk is one of three materials that has a special interaction with starlight. Silk insulates starlight, affecting both starlight itself, and the effects of any spells using starlight. As such, silk itself it exceptionally difficult, indeed nearly impossible, to affect using runic magic. Since it insulates against starlight, silk is often used as a barrier to keep starlight and starlight runes from being contaminated. Silk can also be used to carry starlight, although crystals are usually easier and more efficient.

        #### Tennent of Flesh ####
            The flesh of living and once living things absorbs a small amount of starlight. The older the flesh, the more starlight it can hold. Living things absorb more than dead things, but both can prove both useful and problematic. Runemages can absorb a little extra starlight in their own bodies for personal use, and wooden staves and insignia are often used both as storage when crystals are lacking, and to control and dampen the energies involved in working spells. Ancient trees are particularly large resovoirs of starlight, and can even sometimes warp and bend reality about themselves in the dark of night, when the stars flow brightest. Likewise, flesh is a buffer to runecraft, both for good and ill. Wooden runes are a special case due to the Tennent of Flesh. Since wood absorbs some starlight, and a rune can cause the casting of a spell, small, subtle spells can be crafted which have an almost continual effect, as the wood absorbs starlight, and then the spell effect goes off when enough starlight becomes present.
            Coaxing starlight out of flesh takes a special skill, which not many are capable of. However, of particular note, the exchange between the difference of living flesh and dead flesh is rapid. Thus, killing a starlight vessel will expel all the starlight that the once living flesh can no longer hold. This is a practice taboo among runemages, not the least because it taints the starlight released with the death of its host. Still, in darker parts of the world, some runemages practice sacrifice as a gateway to greater power.

        #### Tennent of Tin ####
            Tin is the final material which has special interaction with starlight. Tin reflects starlight. To those sensitive to such things, it forms a perfect mirror in starlight. It is impossible to affect directly and is often used in protection against runic mages. Even in diluted form it still retains some effect, so bronze is a good general defense as it can be formed into armor which isn't uselessly soft against more conventional attacks. Vessels of tin create odd echoes and interference when dealing with starlight, and most runemages avoid the material.

        #### Tennent of Ice ####
            The Law of Resistance states that starlight is affected by physical materials, but what becomes of the starlight which is absorbed by Resistance? While most conventional energies dissipate into heat, starlight dissipates into cold. Objects affected by starlight magic get colder, and those targeted by spells get a slight chill. Starlight which is not absorbed glides freely over materials and only the slightest cold can be felt in a starfall. Most will never notice its touch. When very powerful spells are worked on physical materials, frost and rhime form, a dead giveaway that powerful magic is present. All runic spells pass in some form through their focal rune. Therefore runes become colder in the working of spells. For powerful spells, this can be problematic, depending on the material used.
            While ice forms when starlight is absorbed by physical materials, and energies get less active, the "ice" of the mental and emotional realm is expressed as fatigue. In reality this is a deadening or slowing of emotion and thought, but it is mostly experienced as fatigue. This is most present in the caster himself, for any spell cast passes in some relationship with his own thoughts and desires. Casting many or powerful spells tires a rune caster and in the most extreme cases, might even put him in an extended coma or even cause death.

    ### Law of Resonance ###
        The Law of Resonance seems obvious, but it defines several subtlties that might not at first be apparent. All starlight resonates with starlight. Given that distance is not a barrier, any effect upon starlight is detectable to all other starlight which is not blocked by some barrier (see the Law of Resistance.) Thus, the working of starlight is readily detectible by other workers of starlight. Furthermore, as starlight is colored by the objects and emotions it is in contact with, it begins to resonate with the things it is colored by. Strongly currents of starlight, usually directed via a rune, and sufficiently large pools will begin to affect all things it resonates with. Smaller concentrations of starlight is instead affected by that which it is colored by. Great effect can be had on the world by concentrating enough starlight. More practically, detectors of a great many things can be crafted from small pools of starlight.
        An even more subtle interaction can be observed in the connection between things coloring starlight. As one object resonates with starlight, and another object resonates with the same source of starlight, the two objects in turn resonate with each other, and can begin to affect one another. Physical things typically have too much resistance for this to occur; it would take an enormous pool of starlight to do so. Thoughts and emotions however, are easily swayed. Negative emotions can begin to affect all things around a rogue pool of starlight, and likewise positive thoughts bring about positive change in the world.

        #### Tennent of Transference ####
            Given that materials can resonate with starlight, and all starlight resonates with all other sources of starlight, one might begin to think that all things would resonate with all other things. In a certain sense this is true, however starlight does not transfer its coloring to other sources of starlight. The resonance of materials do not transfer from one source of starlight to another, and thus the resonance does not carry through.
